Feature-Finding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed the way nearby local maxima are "merged," i.e., interpreted as parts of the same feature. This improved accuracy in crowded images. For some data, it may have no effect, but for others it will give significantly different (but, we think, better) results than previous versions of trackpy. :issue:`143`.

- The minimum feature separation can be as small as zero. Formerly, it was constrained to be larger than the feature diameter. :issue:`139`
